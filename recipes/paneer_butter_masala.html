<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Ripe, red & juicy tomatoes:</strong>Tomatoes are a key ingredient here and form the base of the makhani sauce.</li>
        <li><strong>Raw Cashews:</strong>Yet another important ingredient for the gravy is cashews. The nuts impart a lovely creaminess and sheen in the dish, and the sweetness of the cashews help to balance the tanginess of the tomatoes.</li>
        <li><strong>Cream:</strong>In addition to using cashew paste, this Butter Paneer recipe calls for cream to help thicken the sauce and add richness.</li>
        <li><strong>Butter:</strong>The amount of butter that is added is just right in this paneer butter masala recipe. Butter makes the curry luxurious and, well… buttery.</li>
        <li><strong>Paneer:</strong>The quality of your paneer can make or break your dish. What you want are succulent, soft paneer cubes gently coated with a smooth, buttery tomato sauce.Make sure to use either Homemade Paneer or good quality store bought paneer.</li>
        <li><strong>Spices & Herbs:</strong>One reason this recipe is so great for weeknights is that the list of herbs and spices isn’t intimidatingly long. For that brilliant orange color, you need to add Kashmiri red chilli powder.

            If you don’t have any on hand, you can sub it with cayenne pepper or sweet paprika instead. You will also need garam masala powder. Kasuri methi, which are dried fenugreek leaves, also add good flavor.</li>

<h2>Steps to make restaurant-style-paneer-butter-masala:</h2>
<p><ol>
    <li>1. Soak 18 to 20 cashews in ⅓ cup hot water for 20 to 30 minutes.

    </li>
    <li>While the cashews are soaking, you can prep the other ingredients. It’s time for chopping tomatoes, chopping and preparing the ginger-garlic paste, and slicing paneer into cubes.</li>
    <li>To make the ginger garlic paste, crush a 1 inch piece of peeled ginger with 3 to 4 small to medium-sized garlic cloves in a mortar & pestle. Continue crushing until it is a semi-fine or fine paste. Keep aside.</li>
    <li>After 20 to 30 minutes, drain the water and add the soaked cashews to a blender or mixer-grinder.

        Also, add 2 to 3 tablespoons fresh water (or as much as is required to blend to a fine paste).</li>
        <li>Blend to a smooth paste without any tiny bits or chunks of cashews. Remove the cashew paste from the blender and set it aside.

        </li>
        <li>In the same blender, add 2 cups of diced or roughly chopped tomatoes</li>
        <li>Blend to a smooth tomato puree. Set aside.</li>
        <h3>Making tomato gravy</h3>
        <li>Heat a thick bottomed pan or a heavy pan. Keep the heat to a low or medium-low. Add 2 tablespoons (or 3 to 4 tablespoons for a richer version) butter in a pan. Either salted or unsalted butter can be used.</li>
        <li>Keep the the heat to a low. Add 1 medium-sized tej patta and fry for 2 to 3 seconds, or until fragrant.

        </li>
        <li>Add the prepared crushed ginger-garlic or 1 teaspoon ready-made ginger-garlic paste.</li>
       
        <li>Sauté until the raw aroma of the ginger-garlic disappears, about 10 to 12 seconds.</li>
        <li>Pour in the prepared tomato purée.</li>
        <li>Mix it very well with the butter.</li>
        <li>Begin to cook the tomato purée on a low to medium-low heat. Stir at intervals.

        </li>
        <li>The tomato purée mixture will start simmering.</li>
        <li>If the tomato purée splutters too much while cooking, then cover the pan partly with a lid or cover fully with a splatter guard (channi lid).</li>
        <li>Continue stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>Simmer the purée for 5 to 6 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add 1 teaspoon Kashmiri red chili powder or deghi mirch.

            You can also opt to add just ½ teaspoon Kashmiri red chili powder, or ¼ – ½ teaspoon of cayenne, paprika or any other variety of red chilli powder that you prefer.
        </li>
        <li>Mix well and continue to stir and sauté the tomato purée.</li>
        <li>Sauté till the butter starts leaving the sides of the pan and the entire tomato purée mixture comes together as more of a thick paste.

            Note: This entire cooking/sautéing process takes about 14 to 17 minutes on a low to medium-low heat. Time will vary depending on the thickness of the pan, size, the intensity of flame etc.
        </l>
        <li>Now add the prepared cashew paste.</li>
        <li>Mix the cashew paste very well with the cooked tomato puree and continue to stir and sauté on a low to medium-low heat.

            After adding cashew paste, be sure to continuously stir the gravy.
        </li>
        <li>Sauté until the cashew paste is cooked and the oil begins to leave the sides of the masala. The cashew will cook quickly, just around 3 to 4 minutes on a low heat. And don’t forget to keep on stirring non-stop!

        </li>
        <li>Next add 1.5 cups water.</li>
        <h3>Make Paneer Butter Masala
        </h3>
        <li>Mix the water very well with the tomato-cashew masala. If there are lumps, then break them with a spoon or use a wired whisk for mixing

        </li>
        <li>Let the curry simmer and come to a boil on a low to medium-low heat. Stir occasionally.

        </li>
        <li>After 2 to 3 mins, add ginger julienne (about 1-inch ginger – cut in thin, matchstick-like strips). Reserve a few for garnishing. The curry will begin to thicken.

        </li>
        <li>After 3 to 4 minutes, add 1 or 2 slit green chiles.</li>
        <li>Also add salt to taste and, if necessary, ¼ to 1 teaspoon sugar depending on the sourness of the tomatoes.

            <em>Tip: If you add cream, then you will need to add less sugar. You can also opt to omit sugar entirely if you prefer.</em></li>
            <li>Mix very well and simmer for a minute.</li>
            <li>After the gravy thickens to your desired consistency, then add the paneer cubes (200 or 250 grams). <em>Tip: Keep in mind the consistency you want before you add paneer, as you will be cooking the paneer for just a few seconds, until it is warmed through. You can also fry the paneer and then add it once the gravy is to your liking.</em></li>
            <li> Stir and mix the paneer cubes gently in the gravy. You can switch off the heat at this point. <em>Tip: If your paneer still tastes raw at this point, leave the heat on low until after you add the cream in step 35.</em></li>
            <li>Now quickly add 1 teaspoon crushed dry fenugreek leaves (kasuri methi leaves) and 1 teaspoon garam masala to the gravy. <em>Note: The addition of crushed dry fenugreek leaves gives a restaurant flavor to this curry, but it is optional and can be skipped.</em></li>
            <li>Next add 2 to 3 tablespoons of low-fat or light cream or 1 to 2 tablespoons of heavy whipping cream.</li>
            <li>Stir gently but well. If you haven’t yet, switch off the heat.</li>
            <li>Serve Paneer Butter Masala hot garnished with 1 to 2 tablespoons of chopped coriander leaves (cilantro) and the remaining ginger julienne. You can also drizzle some cream or dot with butter while serving. Enjoy!</li>
